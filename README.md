# Predictive Lead Scoring using ML

### Overview:
Predictive Lead Scoring is a method used to analyze lead behavior in historical customer data to find patterns resulting in a positive business outcome, such as a closed deal with a client. In this study, I developed a lead scoring model using the [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) dataset, which contains the outcome of clients subscribing to a term deposit or not based on a direct marketing campaign performed by a Portuguese bank.

**Model Design:**

Since the evaluation of a classification model is tricky, I assumed that Losing a potential customer cost > Sales Resource Cost as a business objective, which statistically translates to developing a model that gives Low False Negatives and High True Positives, with balancing False Positives.

**Model Outcome:**

To mimic a real-time model evaluation, I separated ~10,000 observation points from the dataset and trained on ~30,000 observation points. The following is the result of my trained LightGBM model on the hold-out dataset.

>  75.04% of Leads predicted by the model have resulted in conversion. And, a 29.56% False Positive rate, 24.95% False Negative Rate is observed.
